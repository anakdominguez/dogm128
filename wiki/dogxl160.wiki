<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

= Library Support =

Version v1.08 and above also support the DOGXL160 display.


<table><tr><td>

== Introduction ==

The DOGXL160 has 160x104 pixel. Each pixel can have one of 4 different values:
 * Pixel off (value 0)
 * Light gray (value 1)
 * Dark gray (value 2)
 * Black (value 3)

== BW and GR Modes ==

For the DOGXL160 display, two different modes are available (See also the [install install] wiki page for configuration of the library):
 * {{{DOGXL160_HW_BW}}}: A black and white mode, which does not support gray levels. It is faster than  {{{DOGXL160_HW_GR}}} mode. Only values 0 and 3 can be used.
 * {{{DOGXL160_HW_GR}}}: Supports gray levels (all pixel values) for the DOGXL160
