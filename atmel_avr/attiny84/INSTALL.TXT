This is the dogm128 library.
The dogm128 library is a C/C++ interface to the ST7565R based graphics module.
Display types DOGM128, DOGM132 and DOGS102 are supported.

for install instructions.

Install instruction for plain Atmel AVR ATTINY microcontroller

  1. Setup Environment
      a) GNU C Compiler for Atmel AVR (`sudo apt-get install gcc-avr`)
      b) Atmel AVR Programmer avrdude (`sudo apt-get install avrdude`)
      c) gnu make
      d) Programmer Hardware for Atmel ISP interface (see http://www.atmel.com/products/avr/ or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmel_AVR)
  2. Download latest version of dogm128_avr_vX.XX.zip
  3. Extract zip file and change directory to graphics test example
  4. Change the Makefile according to your hardware.
      a) Line `MCU:=attiny84`
	  Add the name of the target device. Valid names are reported with the avr-gcc -dumpspec  command.
	  MCU names (devices) are also listed here: http://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/user-manual/index.html
      b) Line `F_CPU:=8000000'
	  Set the frequency of the target environment. The examples of this library will try to assign maximum speed.
      c) Line `DOGDEFS = -DDOGM132_HW' 
	  Select display (DOGM128_HW, DOGM132_HW or DOGS102_HW)
      d) DOGDEFS += -DDOG_SPI_CS_PORT=B -DDOG_SPI_CS_PIN=0
	  I/O port and bit number which is connected to the chip select line of the display.
      e) DOGDEFS += -DDOG_SPI_A0_PORT=B -DDOG_SPI_A0_PIN=1
	  I/O port and bit number which is connected to the A0 line of the display.
      f) DOGDEFS += -DDOG_SPI_SCL_PORT=A -DDOG_SPI_SCL_PIN=4
	  Port and pin of the SCL output line of the Atmel AVR USI interface
      g) DOGDEFS += -DDOG_SPI_DO_PORT=A -DDOG_SPI_DO_PIN=5
	  Port and pin of the DO output line of the Atmel AVR USI interface
  5. Create hex-file and upload the hexfile to the controller: `make upload` 
  6. Setup a new project:
      a) Create a new directory, copy the modified Makefile into the new directory.
      b) `TARGETNAME = project_name`
	  Assign the project name.
      c) `DOGDIR = ../../lib/`
	  Set the location of the dogm128 library if required.
      d) `SRC = file1.c file2.c file3.c`
	  Add list of the c-files of the project.
